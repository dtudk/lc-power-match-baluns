# Derivations

## Summary
This directory contains notebooks to show how the design equations for the novel four-element LC baluns were found.
Notebooks are also included to show why other topologies cannot be power matching LC baluns for arbitrary complex impedances.

## Dependencies
The dependencies for the notebooks can be installed with by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in this directory.
The requirements at [https://lcapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://lcapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) must also be installed.

## Contents
- `valid` contains notebooks with derivations for the four novel four-element power matching LC baluns.
- `invalid` contains notebooks showing that other three-element and four-element topologies cannot be power matching LC baluns for arbitrary complex impedances.
