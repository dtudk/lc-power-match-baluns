# Experimental Verification

## Summary
This directory contains code and data to support the experimental verification of the novel four-element LC baluns.

## Dependencies
The dependencies for the notebooks can be installed with by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in this directory.

## Contents
- `raw_data` contains measurements of the fabricated networks as two-port Touchstone files representing each pair of ports.
- `combine_results.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook for combining sets of two-port Touchstone files in `raw_data` to three-port Touchstone files in `processed_data`.
- `processed_data` contains measurements of the fabricated networks after being combined into three-port parameters.
- `ads_data` contains Touchstone files containing differential two-port results from Keysight Advanced Design System, either from performing electromagnetic co-simulations on the PCB designs or from simulating the Touchstone files in `processed_data`. These files have had de-embedding applied, but not renormalisation.
- `generate_figures.ipynb` performs renormalisation on the Touchstone files in `ads_data`, calculates power wave reflection coefficients and insertion loss, and displays these as figures. These figures are also saved to the `images` directory.
- `images` contains generated figures to display the simulation and experiment results.
